# No framework single page application

This project is about an attempt to implement my personal website. The idea was to make a single page application with no framework. I managed to implement many features like routing and data binding, but I struggled on the conditional and list rendering. I didn't find any satisfying solution for the last features, and that is why I will not be spending more time on this front-end implementation of my personal website that is requiring too much effort, even if I believe that a solution exist.  

Nevertheless I learned many concepts about Javascript, and Webpack, and for that I consider that I didn't lose my time. I will keep this project in my repository for documentation purposes.
